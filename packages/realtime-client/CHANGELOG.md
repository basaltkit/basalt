# @basaltkit/realtime-client

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 104cfb3: Package-manifest hygiene: a uniform `engines.node`, `sideEffects: false` everywhere, and one zod range.
  
  Three metadata inconsistencies the ecosystem review surfaced, fixed in one sweep — no runtime code changes.
  
  - **`engines.node` was declared on 11 of 85 packages.** Only the `*-sqlite` ones carried `>=22.5.0` (they need `node:sqlite`); the other 74 declared nothing, so `npm install` could not warn anyone on an unsupported runtime. Every package now declares `>=22.5.0` — the floor CI actually exercises, and the floor the sqlite packages already required.
  - **`sideEffects` was absent from all 85.** No package relies on import-time side effects (there is not a single bare `import '@basaltkit/…'` in the tree), so every one now declares `"sideEffects": false` and bundlers can drop unused imports from an app's build.
  - **zod range divergence.** 42 packages allowed `^3.24.0 || ^4.0.0`; `@basaltkit/ai` and `@basaltkit/create-app` pinned `^4.0.0` alone — the only external-dependency inconsistency in the monorepo, and enough to force a duplicate zod into an app that is still on 3.x. Both now use the shared range.

## 1.0.5

### Patch Changes

- Lockstep 1.0.5 release. No code changes in this package; it moves with the
  ecosystem-wide durable/Redis backend expansion (tenancy, events outbox,
  webhooks, rate-limiting, idempotency). Internal `@basaltkit/*` dependencies now
  use caret ranges (`workspace:^`).

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- **First stable release.** The public API is now covered by semantic versioning: breaking changes only in a new major, features in a minor, fixes in a patch. No functional change from 0.32.0 — this release marks the stability commitment across the `@basaltkit/*` ecosystem.

### Minor Changes

- 9b08e07: New package: `@basaltkit/realtime-client` — the browser client for `@basaltkit/realtime`.

  A zero-dependency client that subscribes to per-tenant channels and receives events over WebSocket (bidirectional, sends subscribe/unsubscribe) or SSE (receive-only), routing them by channel + event to handlers. Registering a handler auto-subscribes the channel, and the client re-subscribes every active channel when the connection (re)opens. Auto-reconnect uses exponential backoff (configurable, or `reconnect: false`), and `close()` stops it. The `WebSocket`/`EventSource` implementations are injectable, so the whole client — subscription, routing, reconnect, lifecycle events — is unit-tested with fakes, no browser or server required.
