"@machize/flags": minor
"@machize/webhooks": minor

Two new packages:

- `@machize/flags` — feature flags evaluated against a context (falling back to the request's tenant/user), with per-tenant and per-user overrides, deterministic percentage rollouts, and custom rules. `defineFlags`, `flagsPlugin`, `FLAGS`.
- `@machize/webhooks` — outbound webhooks with HMAC-signed delivery (Stripe-style `t=…,v1=…`), retries with exponential backoff, per-tenant subscriptions, and automatic tenant-scoped dispatch from domain events. `webhooksPlugin`, `WEBHOOKS`, `WebhookDeliverer`, `verifySignature`.
