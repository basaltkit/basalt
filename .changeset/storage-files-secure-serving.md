**Security: signed download URLs default to `Content-Disposition: attachment`; uploads get a default size cap.**

**What was exposed.** Uploads trusted the client's declared Content-Type end-to-end and `temporaryUrl` presigned bare GET URLs, so an uploaded `text/html`/`image/svg+xml` object rendered top-level on the storage/CDN origin — stored XSS when that origin is CNAME'd onto the app domain. `Files` validation also defaulted to open (no size cap).

**What changed.** `Disk.temporaryUrl` (and the S3/Azure/GCS drivers) now pin `Content-Disposition: attachment` on every signed URL by default; top-level inline rendering is a deliberate opt-in — `temporaryUrl(path, expiresIn, { disposition: 'inline' })` (also threaded through `Files.temporaryUrl`). Embedded uses (`<img>`, `<video>`) are unaffected by disposition, so avatars/previews inside pages keep working. `Files` uploads are capped at 25 MiB by default (`DEFAULT_MAX_FILE_SIZE`, new export) when no `validate.maxSize` is configured — raise or override explicitly. A MIME denylist was deliberately **not** added: the disposition pin closes the render-time vector at the right layer without breaking legitimate HTML/SVG storage. Custom `StorageDriver` implementations: `temporaryUrl` gains an optional third parameter (`TemporaryUrlOptions`, new export) — implementations that ignore it keep compiling but should honor it.
