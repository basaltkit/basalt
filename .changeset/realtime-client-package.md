'@machize/realtime-client': minor
---

New package: `@machize/realtime-client` — the browser client for `@machize/realtime`.

A zero-dependency client that subscribes to per-tenant channels and receives events over WebSocket (bidirectional, sends subscribe/unsubscribe) or SSE (receive-only), routing them by channel + event to handlers. Registering a handler auto-subscribes the channel, and the client re-subscribes every active channel when the connection (re)opens. Auto-reconnect uses exponential backoff (configurable, or `reconnect: false`), and `close()` stops it. The `WebSocket`/`EventSource` implementations are injectable, so the whole client — subscription, routing, reconnect, lifecycle events — is unit-tested with fakes, no browser or server required.
