"@basaltkit/subscriptions": patch
---

Depend on the neutral HTTP contract, not the Fastify adapter.

The package imported `route`/`BasaltRoute`/`RouteGuard`/`RequestEnricher` through `@basaltkit/fastify`, which merely re-exports them from `@basaltkit/http` — but carries a hard `fastify` dependency. Imports now come straight from `@basaltkit/http`, and the runtime dependency swaps `@basaltkit/fastify` → `@basaltkit/http` (`@basaltkit/fastify` stays as a devDependency for the test suite). Express and Hono apps no longer install Fastify transitively through this package. No public API change — the symbols are byte-identical re-exports.
